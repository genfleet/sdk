"""
The MCP symbols `Agent` imports lazily, asserted to still exist.

Not a test that MCP works — that is MCP's job. This pins the *contract this
SDK depends on*, which nothing else covers: the imports live inside methods, so
a breaking change in the `mcp` package surfaces only when a user with MCPs
configured actually runs an agent.

Found during a security upgrade that moved `mcp` from 1.x to 2.0. The suite was
green throughout, because no test reached this code at all.
