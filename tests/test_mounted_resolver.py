`MountedToolResolver` — the sandbox path, where tools arrive as directories.

The engine resolves each name to a digest on the *host*, verifies the bytes
and mounts them read-only; by the time this resolver runs there is nothing to
authenticate to. So every test here is a directory on disk, which is exactly
the resolver's whole world.
